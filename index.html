                </div>
                <p>HTML 5 introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites. Some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block and inline elements.</p>

                </div>
                <p>A scripting language like JavaScript (JS, for those in the know) does the heavy lifting by telling computer programs like websites or web applications to “do something”.
                    All major web browsers come with built-in engines that can render JavaScript.

                <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.</p>

                <p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
                    JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
                    JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
                    JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand</p>

                </div>
                <p>Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.</p>

                    Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.
